				<h1>About</h1>

			<div class="AboutUs">
				<p>Hi, I’m Alexandrea, the founder of Picnics & Parties Co., based in 
				southern New Hampshire.</p>
                <p>I started Picnics & Parties Co. in 2025, inspired by my deep love for 
				tea parties, antique china, beautifully styled picnics, and capturing 
				meaningful moments through photography. What began as a personal passion 
				grew into a way to help others slow down, connect, and celebrate life’s 
				sweet moments.</p>
				<p>Picnics & Parties Co. offers luxury picnic setups and affordable photography, 
				because I believe beautiful experiences and lasting memories shouldn’t have 
				to come with a luxury price tag. From high tea in the park to cozy backyard 
				gatherings, I create charming spaces and take candid, relaxed photos that help 
				people feel present and celebrated.</p>
				<p>At the heart of it all is my love for hosting and making everyday 
				moments feel special. My mission is simple: to offer gatherings that 
				feel elegant but approachable, and to make it easy for people to savor 
				time together, with a little extra beauty and care.</p>
				<p>Why choose us? So much of what’s out there feels mass-produced, cheap, 
				and tacky. We’re the opposite. Every item in our collection is carefully 
				hand-chosen, featuring fine quality China and porcelain. Our vibe is dreamy, 
				vintage, and totally unique—made for those who want something special.</p>

				<h2>Built with Love</h2>
				<p>Picnics & Parties Co. is something my fiancé and I are building together. 
				He works behind the scenes helping with setup, website design, and everything 
				in between. Every booking brings us one step closer to our own wedding day, 
				with all profits going directly toward our wedding fund. When you support us, 
				you're not just booking a beautiful experience, you're becoming part of our 
				story. Thank you for being here.</p>
